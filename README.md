# Homework-6-Solution
# Behavioral Design Pattern

## Overview

This repo contains two simple Java examples of behavioral design patterns:

- **Chain of Responsibility** – simulates a tech support system with multiple support levels (FAQ bot, junior, senior).
- **Command Pattern** – simulates a smart home remote control with support for undo operations.

## Structure

- `src/ChainOfResponsibilityDemo.java` – handles issues like password resets, billing, etc.
- `src/CommandPatternDemo.java` – controls devices like lights and thermostats using command objects.
